Wire is a code generation tool that automates connecting components using
[dependency injection][]. Dependencies between components are represented in
Wire as function parameters, encouraging explicit initialization instead of
global variables. Because Wire operates without runtime state or reflection,
code written to be used with Wire is useful even for hand-written
initialization.

For an overview, see the [introductory blog post](https://blog.golang.org/wire).

## Installing

```sh
go install github.com/goforj/wire/cmd/wire@latest
```

Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

## Compatibility with google/wire

Wire remains compatible with codebases that import `github.com/google/wire`.
The generator emits a `//go:generate` directive pointing at this fork so
`go generate` consistently uses the maintained toolchain.

To keep existing imports unchanged:

```sh
go mod edit -replace=github.com/google/wire=github.com/goforj/wire@latest
```

## How Wire Works (in 60 seconds)

Wire is a **compile-time dependency injection** tool. Instead of building a runtime
container, Wire generates ordinary Go code that explicitly initializes your
application.

There are only two concepts to learn:

### Providers

A provider is a normal Go function that produces a value (and optionally an error).

```go
func NewDB(cfg Config) (*sql.DB, error) {
    // ...
}
````

Dependencies are expressed as function parameters - no globals, no hidden state.

### Injectors

An injector is a stub function whose body calls `wire.Build(...)`.
Wire replaces this stub with generated code that calls providers in dependency
order.

```go
func InitializeApp(cfg Config) (*App, error) {
    wire.Build(AppSet)
    return nil, nil
}
```

The generated output is plain Go - readable, debuggable, and fast.

## Minimal Example

```go
// providers.go
type Message string

func ProvideMessage() Message {
    return "hello wire"
}

type Greeter struct {
    Msg Message
}

func NewGreeter(msg Message) *Greeter {
    return &Greeter{Msg: msg}
}

var GreeterSet = wire.NewSet(
    ProvideMessage,
    NewGreeter,
)
```

```go
// wire.go
//go:build wireinject

func InitializeGreeter() *Greeter {
    wire.Build(GreeterSet)
    return nil
}
```

Generate the injector:

```sh
wire
```

Wire produces `wire_gen.go` containing explicit initialization code with no
runtime dependency on Wire.

## Running generation manually

Run the default command (alias for `wire gen`) or specify packages:

```sh
wire
wire gen ./...
```

## Watching for changes

Wire includes a native watcher that re-runs generation on Go file changes:

```sh
wire watch
wire watch ./...
```

Detects the package root automatically and uses native filesystem notifications when available (with a polling fallback).

## Design Guidance

Wire favors explicitness and long-term maintainability:

* Prefer **small provider sets**, especially in libraries
* Avoid injecting common types like `string`; define distinct types instead
* Treat provider sets as **public APIs** with compatibility guarantees
* Use struct providers and interface bindings to keep graphs readable

For detailed guidance, see **Best Practices**.

## When Not to Use Wire

Wire is designed for medium-to-large Go applications with non-trivial
initialization logic.

For small programs with only a handful of dependencies, hand-written
initialization is often simpler and clearer.

## Project Status

This fork tracks the original Wire feature set while prioritizing performance,
determinism, and documentation. Compatibility with existing Wire codebases is a
core goal.
